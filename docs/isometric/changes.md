## 2026-02-11

- **Scope:** Sampling method enforcement baseline
- **Updated by:** Codex
- Schema/workflow changes:
  - Added `sampling_method` enum (`method_a`, `method_b`) and `credit_batches.sampling_method`.
  - Added optional convenience default `facilities.default_sampling_method`.
  - Added server-side Method B eligibility evaluation (reactor-scoped proxy) for:
    - minimum 30 prior samples before Method B
    - 1-in-10 sampled-run cadence during reporting period
  - Added DB trigger guardrail to block ineligible `sampling_method=method_b`.
  - Added immutable lock for `sampling_method` after `credit_batches` reaches `verified`/`issued`.
  - Updated Isometric condition registry and schema mapping entries for sampling-method rules.
- Migration: guardrails and columns updated in `drizzle/0000_lowly_grim_reaper.sql`.

- **Scope:** Durability immutability guardrail
- **Updated by:** Codex
- Schema/workflow changes:
  - Added DB trigger guardrail to freeze `credit_batches` durability fields once batch status is `verified` or `issued`.
  - Documented the guardrail in the condition registry as `durability.lock_after_verification`.
- Migration: guardrail SQL squashed into `drizzle/0000_lowly_grim_reaper.sql`.

## 2026-02-10

- **Scope:** Phase 2 schema + validation alignment (greenfield reset)
- **Updated by:** Codex
- Schema/workflow changes:
  - Added condition registry and explicit requiredness model (`required`, `conditional_required`, `optional`).
  - Added `customer_locations`; linked orders to required location; added optional delivery location override.
  - Added `deliveries.mass_dry_kg` and `deliveries.delivered_wet_mass_kg` with consistency checks.
  - Normalized coordinates to `gps_latitude`/`gps_longitude` with range checks.
  - `transport_legs` confirmed as canonical transport accounting model.
  - Added Isometric lifecycle fields (`version`, `status`, `submitted_at`, `superseded_at`) on submission tables.
  - Added `isometric_sources` and `isometric_monitoring_submissions`.
  - Added compliance ledgers: `feedstock_sc_assessments`, `custody_handoffs`, `ghg_materiality_assessments`.
  - Added server-layer conditional validators and dry-mass derivation utility with tests.
- Migration: replaced legacy baseline with squashed `drizzle/0000_lowly_grim_reaper.sql`.
